# Getting Started 

First, we must clone the repository on our premises. Once we have it cloned, we will go to the root folder of the Front project.
We can see the package.json file. This file contains all dependencies installed for the react project. Once we are sure that we are located at the same level as this file, we install all the dependencies using the npm install instruction

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
